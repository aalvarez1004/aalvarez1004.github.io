<p>- In this project we will analyze in depth <b>air pollution in Mataró</b> from 1999 to the end of 2023. </p>
<p>- The image provided will be an essential tool for our analysis, as it presents a series of detailed line graphs that represent the evolution of various pollutants in the air during this period.<p>
<p>- The graphs are organized in three rows, each one showing data related to different aspects: <b>by hour, by month and by day of the week.</b>
Each graph has different colored lines representing different types of pollutants, including <b>NO2, PM10, NOx, CO, SO2, NO, O3, PS and HCT.</b></p>
<p>- These graphs will allow us to observe fluctuations in the levels of these contaminants over time, which will provide crucial information for our analysis. For example, we will be able to identify <b>temporal patterns in air pollution</b>, such as whether levels of certain pollutants tend to be higher during certain hours of the day, months of the year, or days of the week. </p>
<p>- Furthermore, by comparing the levels of different pollutants we will be able to better understand the composition of air pollution in Mataró and how it has changed over time. This could reveal valuable information about the <b>sources of air pollution in the region and how they have evolved over time.</b></p>
<p>- In summary, this panorama will provide a solid basis for our analysis of air pollution in Mataró. Through our <b>detailed analysis</b>, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of this critical environmental issue and contribute to efforts to address it. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
   The graph provided is a heat map that represents <b>the evolution of carbon monoxide (CO)</b> in Mataró from 1999 to 2023. Carbon monoxide is an <u>atmospheric pollutant</u > that may have harmful effects on human health and the environment. The colors of the graph vary from <b>red</b>, which indicates <u>high levels of CO</u>, to <b>dark blue</b>, which indicates <u>low levels</u>. This color coding allows an <b>intuitive visualization</b> of the images on the CO levels throughout the time.

   From the interpretation of the colors, it is possible to observe a <b>visible trend</b> towards the <b>reduction of carbon monoxide</b> over time. The <u>warmest colors</u>, which indicate <b>high levels of CO</b>, are most prominent in the <u>primers any of the representations</u> in the graph (approximately 1999-2000). As the time progresses, the colors become <b>refredant gradually</b>, which indicates a <u>decrease in CO levels</u>.

   It is important to keep in mind that <u>there are no available items</u> for any years 2022 and 2023, as indicated in the <u>blue fosc uniform pads</u> of the graph. The absence of data in these cases could be due to various reasons, such as the <u>lack of measurements</u> or the <u>lack of access to data</u>.

   In summary, this graph offers a <b>valuable view</b> of the evolution of carbon monoxide levels in Mataró during the period 1999-2023. The <b>lowering trend</b> of CO levels could be the result of a series of factors, such as <u>minors in emissions</u> and <u>pollution control practices </u>, <u>canvis en l'ús de l'energia</u> or <u>effective environmental policies</u>.

   According to the graph, carbon monoxide levels have decreased significantly (from 4-5-6 to 1-2-3) from the end of 1999 to 2019 (the latest of which data). With many other contaminants, the <u>pics of CO</u> are donated to the <b>nit</b> and during the <b>winter months</b>. The amount of carbon monoxide has exceeded the health limits established by the EU and the WHO, both at the highest levels of 5 and a maximum of 10.

<h4> ‎ ‎ ‎ 3. Nitric Oxide evolution (NO) </h4>
<br>
<div class="img-center">   
<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/trendlevelNO.jpg">
<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/NOEvolution.png">

<p>The graph provided is a heat map representing the evolution of nitric oxide (NO) in Mataró from 1999 to 2023. Nitric oxide is a gas that is formed in the atmosphere when oxygen reacts with nitrogen at high temperatures. The presence of nitric oxide in the air can be harmful to human health and also contributes to the formation of photochemical smog.
In the graph, the colors vary from blue, which indicates low levels of NO, to red, which indicates high levels. This color coding allows an intuitive visualization of the changes in NO levels over time.
From the interpretation of the colors, a visible trend towards the reduction of nitric oxide over time can be observed. The warmer colors, which indicate high NO levels, are more prominent in the first years represented in the graph (1999-2000 approximately). As time progresses, the colors gradually become cooler, indicating a decrease in NO levels.
It is important to note that there is a color scale on the right side of the graph, labeled "NO", which varies from 0 to 5. This scale indicates the five different shades of blue used to represent the data points.</p>


<br> 
<h4> ‎ ‎ ‎ 4. Nitrogen Dioxide evolution (NO2) </h4>
<br>
<div class="img-center">   
<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/trendlevelNO2.jpg">
<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/NO2Evolution.png">


<p>This is a heat map showing the evolution of Nitrogen Dioxide levels in Mataró over several years. Each row represents a year, starting with 1999 at the top and ending with 2023 at the bottom. The columns represent the months, from January to December.
The intensity of the color indicates the level of Nitrogen Dioxide, with the blue representing low levels and the red indicating high levels according to the scale on the right of the image. There are noticeable variations in the levels of Nitrogen Dioxide over the course of each year and between years.
For example, if we look at the year 2005, we can see that the levels of Nitrogen Dioxide were relatively low (blue) during the first months of the year (January to March), but increased (red) towards the middle of the year (June to August), and then decreased a little towards the end of the year (November to December).
These types of graphs are useful to visualize time trends in the data, in this case, the levels of Nitrogen Dioxide in Mataró over time. We can also see if there is any seasonal pattern, such as an increase of Nitrogen Dioxide levels during certain periods of the year.</p> 

	
<br> 
<h4> ‎ ‎ ‎ 5. Nitrogen Oxides evolution (NOX) </h4>

<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/NOXEvolution.png">

	
<p>Is a heat map representing the evolution of Nitrogen Oxides in Mataró from 1999 to 2023. The x-axis represents the years from 1999 to 2023. The y-axis represents different times of the day, from midday to 21:00 hours.
Different colors represent different levels of nitrogen oxide concentration; the darker shades indicate lower concentrations while the red ones indicate higher concentrations. There are noticeable red ticks that indicate higher concentrations at specific times and years, such as around midday in the years around 2000 and 2010.
A color bar on the right indicates the scale of the average concentration of nitrogen oxides, which varies from -20 to +180.
For example, if we look at the year 2000, we can see that there is a higher concentration of nitrogen oxides (green color) around the middle of the day. This trend is repeated in other years, such as 2010. This information can be useful for the planning of air pollution control policies. We can also see if there are any seasonal patterns, such as an increase in nitrogen oxide levels during certain times of the day. This information can be useful for planning air pollution control policies.</p>


<br> 
<h4> ‎ ‎ ‎ 6. Ozone (Trioxygen) evolution (O3) </h4>
<br>    
<div class="img-center">   
<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/trendlevelO3.jpg">
<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/O3Evolution.png">
	
<p>To better understand this image, let's break it down:</p>

<p>- Horizontal axis (X): It represents the years, which go from 1999 to 2023. This allows us to see how the concentration of trioxide has changed over time.</p>
<p>- Vertical axis (Y): Represents different times of the day, ranging from 00:00 to 21:00. This allows us to see how the concentration of trioxygen varies at different times of the day.</p>
<p>- Colors: Represent the average concentration of trioxygen. The light shades indicate low concentrations and the green shades indicate high concentrations. There is a scale on the right that shows the correspondence between the colors and the concentrations of trioxide.</p>
<p>- Now, if we look at some specific details of the image, we can see that there are some areas with more reddish colors, which indicate high concentrations of trioxide. These zones are mainly found around the midday in the years around 2000 and 2010. This could indicate that there have been periods of time during these years when the concentration of trioxigen in Mataró has been particularly high.</p>

<br> 
<h4> ‎ ‎ ‎ 7. Sulfur Dioxide evolution (S02) </h4>
<br>
<div class="img-center">

<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/SO2Evolution.png">

	

<p>- This graph shows the evolution of sulphur dioxide (SO2) in Mataró from 1999 to 2023. Here is a detailed analysis:</p>
<p><b>1. General trend:</b> The graph shows a significant decrease in SO2 levels over the years. This trend indicates that measures to control and reduce pollution have been effective.</p>
<p><b>2. Years with high SO2 levels:</b> It can be observed that around the year 2000, SO2 levels were higher, with concentrations reaching their maximum around 15 µg/m3.</p>	
<p><b>3. Remarkable reduction since 2008:</b> Since 2008, there has been a remarkable reduction in the concentration of SO2. Although there are occasional fluctuations where levels increase slightly, as seen in 2017, the general trend is a steady decrease.</p>
<p><b>4. Monthly variability:</b> Monthly variability also seems to have decreased; extreme fluctuations are less common in recent years.</p>
<p><b>5. Colors of the graph:</b> The darker colors indicate lower levels of the pollutant, while the lighter colors (towards green) indicate higher concentrations of SO2.</p>
	
<br> 
<h4> ‎ ‎ ‎ 8. Polystyrene evolution (Ps) </h4>
<br>    
<div class="img-center">   
<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/trendlevelPS.jpg">
<br>
<p>- Here is the evolution of polystyrene in Mataró from 1999 to 2007: </p>
<p><b>1. High concentration period (1999-2001):</b> The levels of polystyrene were highest between 1999 and 2001. This high concentration can be seen in the darker colors of the graph, which indicate higher levels of polystyrene. These fossilized colors can be observed mainly in the winter months during these first years.</p>
<p><b>2. Significant reduction:</b> From 2001 onwards, the levels of polystyrene decreased significantly and remained low. This decrease can be seen in the lighter colors of the graph. This drastic reduction indicates that there was probably a significant change or intervention around 2001.</p>
<p><b>3. Missing data (after 2001):</b> The following year, 2002, we can no longer find data available for subsequent years until the end of 2023 in this graph. They appear as blank spaces in the graph.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be concluded that there has been a significant reduction in the levels of polystyrene in Mataró since 2001. We have very little data on Polystyrene (only 3 years), so it is very complicated to make a graph to compare and analyze it.</p>
	
<br> 
<h4> ‎ ‎ ‎ 9. Hydrochlorothiazide evolution (HCT) </h4>
<br>    
<div class="img-center">   
<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/trendlevelHCT.jpg">
<br>
<p>- Analyzing the graph provided, it is possible to observe a visual representation of the concentration of hydrochlorothiazide in Mataró over a period of time. A more in-depth analysis of this information is presented below:</p>
<p><b>1. High concentration period (1999-2001):</b> The levels of hydrochlorothiazide were highest between 1999 and 2001. This high concentration can be seen in the darker colors of the graph, which indicate higher levels of hydrochlorothiazide. These darker colors can be observed mainly in the winter months during these first years. This decrease can be seen in the lighter colors of the graph. This drastic reduction indicates that there was probably a significant change or intervention around 2001.</p>
<p><b>2. No data available (after 2000):</b>From the middle of the year 2000, the levels of hydrochlorothiazide decreased significantly, remaining low and it could be said that there is no data available for the years after 2001 in this graph. They appear as blank spaces in the graph indicating that no data are available or have not yet been recorded for these years.</p>
<p>- It can be concluded that there has been a variation in the levels of hydrochlorothiazide in Mataró from 1999 to 2001. For a complete and detailed analysis, it would be essential to have access to more data to understand the current and future trends, with the data we have from only 2 years it is very difficult to make a graph because it is too short and it is not useful to make many conclusions.</p>

<h4> ‎ ‎ ‎ - Conclusion:</h4>
<br>	
<p>- The air pollution analysis project in Mataró has provided a detailed view of the evolution of the levels of the aforementioned elements over several years.

<p>- The heat maps presented have allowed an intuitive visualization of the temporal and daily fluctuations of these pollutants. For example, in some of them a notable variation in levels was observed throughout each year and between different years. Levels appeared to be lower during the first months of the year and increased towards the middle of the year, then decreased towards the end of the year. </p>

<p>- In others, higher concentrations were observed around midday in the years 2000 and 2010. This pattern could be related to factors such as vehicular traffic and industrial activities, which tend to be more intense during these times of day. ‎ Analysis of some gases revealed a similar pattern, with higher concentrations observed during certain times of day and in certain years. However, it is important to note that trioxygen levels can be influenced by a variety of factors, including weather conditions, the amount of sunlight, and the presence of other contaminants in the air. </p>

<p>- Many phenomena can be analyzed and also deduced and could be, for example, a consequence of an increase in emissions due to a growth in industrial activities or vehicle traffic in Mataró during that year. It could also be related to changes in meteorological conditions that could have favored the accumulation of pollutants in the air.</h6>

<p>- In conclusion, this project has provided valuable information on the dynamics of air pollution in Mataró. The observed patterns underscore the importance of continuing to monitor and analyze air pollutant levels to inform pollution control policies and protect public health.
However, they also highlight the need to consider a wide range of factors, including human activities and meteorological conditions, to fully understand variations in air pollution levels. </p>

<br>
<br>	
<p>- The analysis of the different atmospheric pollutants <b>"NO2, PM10, NOx, CO, SO2, NO, O3, PS and HCT"</b> in <b>Mataró</b> throughout several years provides us with a deep understanding of the air quality in the region and how it has changed over time.
Here are some key lessons we can learn from this analysis:</p>

<p>1. <b>Understanding temporal patterns:</b> Heat maps allow us to visualize how pollutant levels vary throughout the day and over years. This can help us identify temporal patterns, such as whether there are certain times of day or times of year when pollution levels tend to be higher.</p>

<p>2. <b>Identification of anomalous events:</b> By looking at data over time, we can identify anomalous events, such as the notable jump in pollution levels in 2005. These events can indicate significant changes in emission sources or environmental conditions. , and warrant further investigation.</p>

<p>3. <b>Assessing the impact of pollution control policies:</b> By comparing pollution levels before and after the implementation of certain pollution control policies, we can evaluate the effectiveness of these policies.</b></p>

<p>4. <b>Air Quality Awareness:</b> This analysis can help raise awareness about air quality in your region and the importance of reducing air pollution.</p>

<p>5. <b>Information for future planning:</b> The data collected and analyzed can be useful for future planning. For example, if a pattern of increased pollution is identified during certain hours of the day, traffic restrictions could be implemented during those hours.</p>

<p>- This analysis provides us with valuable information about air quality in Mataró, which can be useful for various purposes, from planning pollution control policies to raising public awareness about air quality.
However, it also highlights the importance of taking into account a wide range of factors, including human activities and meteorological conditions, to fully understand variations in air pollution levels.</p>

<h4> ‎ ‎ ‎ - Analyzing its location:</h4>
<br>    
<div class="img-center">   
<img style = "height: 100%;" src="https://aalvarez1004.github.io/Programació/ImatgesProgramació/MataróGoogleMaps.jpg">
<br>
<p>- Based on the image and information above, a general analysis can be provided of how the pollution levels of the pollutants <b>NO2, PM10, NOx, CO, SO2, NO, O3, PS and HCT</b> could influence <b>Mataró.</b></p>

<p><b>1. Location and Geographic Factors:</b> Mataró is located near the coast and is surrounded by several other small towns such as Argentona, Cabrera de Mar and Vilassar de Mar.
Proximity to these cities can contribute to cumulative pollution levels due to vehicular traffic and shared industrial activities.</p>

<p><b>2. Industries:</b> There are industries near Mataró or the surrounding cities mentioned above could be a significant source of <b>pollutants</b>, an example of them is <b>Barcelona</b>, one of the cities largest and most populated in <b>Spain</b>, has a significant impact on the surrounding areas, especially in terms of pollution. Barcelona is a center for several industries, including manufacturing, tourism and technology. These industries can contribute to <b>air pollution</b> through the <b>emission of gases and particles.</b> For example, emissions of <b>nitrogen dioxide (NO2)</b> and <b>suspended particles (PM10)</b> are particularly high in Barcelona, tripling the new reference values for air quality, established by the <b>World Health Organization (WHO).</b>
The <b>thermal power plants</b> and <b>cement factories located in the Barcelona conurbation</b> are <b>highly polluting industries.</b> It is also worth noting that Barcelona's pollution can influence Mataró due to <b>geographical proximity and wind patterns.</b> Pollutants can be transported by wind from Barcelona to Mataró, increasing pollution levels in Mataró .

<p><b>3. Vehicular Traffic:</b> Main roads connecting Mataró with other cities could be a significant source of the increase in <b>NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and CO (carbon monoxide)</b> levels, especially during <b>peak hours.</b></p>

<p><b>4. Climatic conditions:</b> The <b>coastal location</b> could have both a <b>positive</b> and <b>negative</b> impact on the <b>pollutant levels.</b> On the one hand it can facilitate the rapid dispersion of <b>smog and other pollutants</b>; on the other hand it could lead to localized accumulation depending on wind and other climatic factors.

<p>- In summary, to fully understand the exact <b>impact and influence</b> on the specific levels mentioned, more detailed information on the specific emission sources present in Mataró as well as <b>historical meteorological data</b> would be needed to correlate with observed patterns.
